# AutoAssistant

## Description

AutoAssistant is a site to search for a car using make, model, and year. Once you have signed up and gotten logged in, you may begin your search. The search returns any results matching your search, and allows you to favorite cars that you like. Once favorited, a favorites page can be visited with all your favorited cars. Also available on the favorites page is a section where you can add notes about each individual car, allowing you to keep your thoughts about them, or to use for comparison.

AutoAssistant was built on the express handlebars templating engine, utilizing both NodeJS and Express.js to create a RESTful API. MySQL was used with the Sequelize ORM to create a database. AutoAssistant was styled with CSS, and drew from the [API Ninjas' Car API](https://api-ninjas.com/api/cars) to obtain the make, model, year, drive type, transmission, cylinders in the engine, and combined (highway/city) mpg. Animations for the favorite and save buttons were done with Animate.css.

Our CRUD process is as follows: 

- Begin with a GET to the welcome page.
- Create a user with a POST to /api/users on submission of the sign up form.
- On successful sign up or login, GET to the search page at /search. The user can then search for a car using make/model/year.
- A subsequent POST to /results creates any new matching results on the page with the parameters listed in the description above.
- Once a user gets their results back, they are able to favorite cars by clicking a heart icon, which then does a POST to /favorites.
- When the user clicks on the Favorites tab in the nav bar, they GET to /favorites and are shown the cars they have favorited from prior searches.
- The user may then add notes to the cars they have favorited, via a PUT to update the notes section beneath the displayed car.
- It is possible to then remove favorites by clicking a trash can icon underneath the car's image, utilizing a DELETE to do so.
